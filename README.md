## Results
To complete the analysis we leveraged [CitiBike](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) site data and based our analysis on July 2028 trips.

#### The Duration of a Typical Ride: Graph 1 & 2
The very first section of our Tableau story examines the distribution of the rides based on their duration. From the charts bellow we can canclude that 5-minute rides are the most frequent and the overwhelming majority of rides, up to 90 percent last no langer than 30 minutes.

#### Weekly and Daily Patterns of the Number of Rides? Graph 4 & 5
Not all days and hours are equal. The visuals bellow allow developing assumptions of the purpose of the ride: are they recreational or business. Also this information is crucial for operational planning of the business, e.g. what is the most suitible time to repaire the bikes.

#### Trip Geography? Graph 6 & 7
The next section of Tableau story is devoted to the geography. As we can see from the chart below the most rides are concentrated in Manhatten and adjucent territories. Our purpose is to nderstand why business works best in certain areas.
That's also worth mentioning that the start and end points of rides are not differ much. Hence, logistics/redistribution costs are supposed not to be too high for the business.
